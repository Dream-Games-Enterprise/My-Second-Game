Add rotating bit to the tail - so it rotates to the direction of the next node in the tail. (this is a bit tricky since it needs to be done for each node in the tail and not just the head)

Jess Minecraft coords for Nether

EXTRA
HAVE SNAKE SPEED EFFECT IF ON HIGHEST 3/2 SPEEDS


BUG
Food is not disappearing when picked up - i assume its being picked up since a see a new food spawns somewhere 
Tail sprites all turn to current direction when they should slither and finish the direction they're going in before turning to follow the tail node/object in front if that makes sense?
Player can swipe when paused and when unpause the player changes to the direction, exploit that needs fixing


Update in Future If Played:
- Moving obstacle nodes?
- Death particle system have it match the sprites of the snake
- Have speed up on food pick up
- Make the colour scroll within sprite selections symmetrical. Left end has more padding than the very end of the scroll on the right (only by a few pixels).
- Add camera options e.g. zoom in/out, follow player, etc. show whole map from start.
- Leaderboard with time on map size completion
