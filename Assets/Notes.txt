BUG
CHECK OBSTALCE MULTIPLIER IS WORKIGN - DOESN'T WORK until player toggles it off and on again first
Player spawns in obstacle, or obstacle spawns on player bug
player can't die to obstacle with no tail - fix this
Tail sprites all turn to current direction when they should slither and finish the direction they're going in before turning to follow the tail node/object in front if that makes sense?
food spawning in tail - Fixed?
