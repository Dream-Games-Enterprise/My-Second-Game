Link up Traps to game manager so the sprites and colour is loaded
Weird bug where trap colour updates food colour







EXTRA
HAVE SNAKE SPEED EFFECT IF ON HIGHEST 3/2 SPEEDS
HAD PARTICLE EFFECT OF SNAKE DISSIPATING WHEN GAME OVER
CUSTOMISAABLE OBSTACLE SPRITES


CORE
Make faster player speeds since 5 feels slow since smoothing the movement
Add particle effects for when food is picked up.
A fading swiping effect for where player inputs
Make turning and swiping practically instant
Personal widget
Leaderboard
Map colours
If hgigher player speed then +1 to each map size camera size so easier to see upcoming obstacles

Have a leaderboard for most points held - just count the bank balance not with sprites and stuff have them toggle to opt in to leaderboard. so need high score for 1 match then total score ever achieved...


BUG
PLAYER FREEZES WHEN INPUTTING TWO DIRECTIONS QUICKLY SINCE IT SEE OPPOSITE DIRECTION 
Price resets when changing scenes even though already equipped - also removes currency again so needs fixing and loading at start to see which ones are unlocked and don't need to cost or have a number displaying
Tail sprites all turn to current direction when they should slither and finish the direction they're going in before turning to follow the tail node/object in front if that makes sense?
food spawning in tail -  
Player can swipe when paused and when unpause the player changes to the direction, exploit that needs fixing



Update in Future If Played:

- Fix obstacles creating dead ends, happens maybe 50% of map generations but can be more, can be less...
- Camera size to zoom out/increase/decrease when player gets bigger
- Moving obstacle nodes?
- Have speed up on food pick up



Refactor Repeated Logic: The MovePlayer() and MoveTail() methods share some logic that could be abstracted into smaller helper functions for better reusability and readability.

Collision Detection:

The collision checks (isTailNode(), isObstacleNode()) are functional, but consider combining them into a single method to streamline the logic.

THIS HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED (NEEDS TO BE CHECKED THO), Touch Input Optimization: You reset touchStartPos after each swipe. This might result in smaller consecutive swipes being misinterpreted. Consider resetting it only at TouchPhase.Ended.


Enhance Rotation Logic:

Tail segment rotation (MoveTail()) calculates direction and rotation but might produce incorrect results for segments turning around corners. Using segment-to-segment direction comparison would enhance accuracy.

Consider adding haptic feedback or sound effects for swipes and collisions to improve player engagement.

Performance Optimisation:
Instead of repeatedly using tail.Exists and foodNodes.Contains, consider a HashSet<Node> for constant-time lookups.
