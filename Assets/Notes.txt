EXTRA
HAVE SNAKE SPEED EFFECT IF ON HIGHEST 3/2 SPEEDS
Have speed up on food pick up
HAD PARTICLE EFFECT OF SNAKE DISSIPATING WHEN GAME OVER
CUSTOMISAABLE OBSTACLE SPRITES
moving obstacle nodes?



CORE
Ensure colours of PLAYER, TAIL, FOOD and OBSTACLES
Add particle effects for when food is picked up.
A fading swiping effect for where player inputs
Personal widget
Leaderboard
Map colours
If hgigher player speed then +1 to each map size camera size so easier to see upcoming obstacles
Camera size to zoom out/increase/decrease when player gets bigger

BUG

Player spawns in obstacle, or obstacle spawns on player bug
Tail sprites all turn to current direction when they should slither and finish the direction they're going in before turning to follow the tail node/object in front if that makes sense?
food spawning in tail - Fixed? 


Update in Future If Played:

- Fix obstacles creating dead ends, happens maybe 50% of map generations but can be more, can be less...


AI Suggestions to gamemanager: Suggestions for Improvement
Refactor Repeated Logic:

The MovePlayer() and MoveTail() methods share some logic that could be abstracted into smaller helper functions for better reusability and readability.
Magic Numbers:

Replace hardcoded values (e.g., minSwipeDistance, 0.6f, 0.7f) with constants or configurable fields to improve maintainability.
Collision Detection:

The collision checks (isTailNode(), isObstacleNode()) are functional, but consider combining them into a single method to streamline the logic.
Touch Input Optimization:

You reset touchStartPos after each swipe. This might result in smaller consecutive swipes being misinterpreted. Consider resetting it only at TouchPhase.Ended.
Enhance Rotation Logic:

Tail segment rotation (MoveTail()) calculates direction and rotation but might produce incorrect results for segments turning around corners. Using segment-to-segment direction comparison would enhance accuracy.
Victory Condition:

Add checks for when all food is consumed and the player wins the game.
UI and Feedback:

Consider adding haptic feedback or sound effects for swipes and collisions to improve player engagement.
Edge Cases:

Ensure edge cases like overlapping obstacles and food are handled during initialization.
Code Comments and Documentation:

While the code is relatively self-explanatory, adding comments for complex logic sections would help maintainability.
Performance Optimization:

Instead of repeatedly using tail.Exists and foodNodes.Contains, consider a HashSet<Node> for constant-time lookups.
