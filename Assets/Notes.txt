CORE
Figure out how (ask chatgpt) at which point of remaining available nodes should complete should count (victory)
MAKE SURE TO ADD SWIPING FOR PHONES AS INPUT
Obstacle nodes may need to check surrounding nodes for obstacles before spawning (check should be something like game over node (obstacle and null) should not have more than 1 next to it)








BUG
Player spawns in obstacle, or obstacle spawns on player bug
player can't die to obstacle with no tail - fix this
