BUG
I think a food can sometimes spawn on the exact spot it gets picked up on 


Update in Future If Played:
- Maybe figure out a way to make slower speeds be more responsive, similar to how reactive/responsive the fastest speed is.
- Add a toggle for different camera options e.g. follow on big maps or just fit.
- Increase map size slider.
- Moving obstacle nodes?
- Death particle system have it match the sprites of the snake.
- Have speed up on food pick up.
- Make the colour scroll within sprite selections symmetrical. Left end has more padding than the very end of the scroll on the right (only by a few pixels).
- Add camera options e.g. zoom in/out, follow player, etc. show whole map from start.
- Leaderboard with time on map size completion.
